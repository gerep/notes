#constraints #
You will never have unlimited time and resources. Figure out what the constraints are and live with them. Go to the edge of your constraints; do not try to ease them. (if this is the equipment you have to write your code, do it)

What is what you are creating for? I know what my blog is for. There is a reason it has no pictures, no audio, and no videos. It was a decision. It has constraints; there is no need to waste time looking for images, video or audio.

Build the boundaries so you can go back to work.
